aib2ofx
==========
...or how to suck data out of AIB's online interface, and format it into ``OFX`` file.
Also supports conversion of AIB e-statements.

Installation
--------------
* ``umask 022``
* ``python setup.py build``
* ``sudo python setup.py install``

If that has completed successfully, you should find ``aib2ofx``
command in your Python's ``bin`` dir.

How to use
------------
Create a ``~/.aib-sucker`` file, with AIB login details. It has a JSON
format, single object with one key per AIB login you want to use.

::

    {
        "bradmajors": {
            "homeNumber": "1234",
            "workNumber": "1234",
            "regNumber": "12345678",
            "pin": "12345"
        }
    }

The fields are, as follows:

homeNumber
  Last four digits of your home number.

workNumber
  Last four digits of your work number.

regNumber
  Your AIB registered number.

pin
  Your five digit PIN.

You can put more than one set of credentials in the file; the script
will download data for all accounts for all logins.

::

    {
        "bradmajors": {
            "homeNumber": "1234",
            "workNumber": "1234",
            "regNumber": "12345678",
            "pin": "12345"
        },
        "janetweiss": {
            "homeNumber": "4321",
            "workNumber": "8765",
            "regNumber": "87654321",
            "pin": "54321"
        }
    }

Note that there's no comma after the last account details. Remember to
run ``chmod 600 ~/.aib-sucker``, to make sure that only you can read
this file.

Once you've prepared that config file, run::

    aib2ofx -d /output/directory

The script should connect to AIB, log in using provided credentials,
iterate through all accounts, and save each of those to a separate
file located in ``/output/directory``.

To convert AIB PDF e-statements, download the statements from online banking and
put them in a folder of your choice.
Then run:

    aib2ofx -d /output/directory -p /pdf/statement/directory

Only checking account e-statements are supported currently.

Guarantee
------------
There is none.

I've written that script with my best intentions, it's not
malicious, it's not sending the data anywhere, it's not doing anything
nasty. I'm using it day to day to get data about my AIB accounts into
a financial program that I use. It should work for you as good as it
works for me. See the ``LICENSE`` file for more details.

Varia
------------
``GM`` directory contains a crude GreaseMonkey version. It allows you
to download transactions in either OFX or CSV format, from *Statement*
page, but you have to do it account by account. See the
``GM/README.rst`` for details.
